                    I’m a student at University of Kent studying Business Information Technology. Currently, I’m on an
                    intermission year and will be returning for my final year in 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before going to university, I had been interested in Web Design/Development, BUT, I did not like to
                    code. I did, however, like to design. I always had a knack in drawing as a child and enjoyed my Art
                    subjects immensely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to university, I saw glimpses of the UX/UI Design world and I was interested.

                <p>
                    My passion for UX sparked when I finished my first year at university, after having learnt Human
                    Computer Interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever I went to university, I couldn’t help but notice designs (physical and digital) that made
                    me think: <span>“Wow! This is such a pain to use for completing such a simple task”</span>. Every time I
                    encountered such designs, I always kept thinking of methods to create a better user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I appreciated the whole UX and Human Centered Design process more and more. I was happy when I found
                    out that there was a profession for creating designs to make life better and easier for people.

                        I’ve always liked to solve puzzles even when I was young, especially the Rubik’s Cube. I had my
                        fair share of speed cubing attempts, and my fastest time was 40 seconds!

                        If I had to choose a sport that only I could do forever in my life, it would be swimming. I was in a swimming club when I was young and I enjoyed every single bit of  it.

                        Some day, I want to start my own clothing brand. I would love to see my designs on some clothing apparels. I think it would be cool for people to wear and represent my brand.

                        I like anime in general. But Attack on Titan is my favourite. If you haven’t watched it, I highly recommend it. If you watch anime, what’s your favourite? Let me know!
