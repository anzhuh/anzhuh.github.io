                <p>
                    I’m a student at University of Kent studying Business Information Technology. Currently, I’m on an
                    intermission year and will be returning for my final year in 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before going to university, I had been interested in Web Design/Development, BUT, I was not as
                    interested in coding. I did, however, like to design. I always had a knack in drawing as a child and
                    enjoyed my Art subjects immensely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a day to day basis, I strive to create things that are just simple and easy to use, really. Minimalism has heavily inspired my way of approaching certain problems. As Leonardo Da Vinci once said, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

                    My passion for UX sparked when I finished my first year at university, after having learnt Human
                    Computer Interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever I went to university, I couldn’t help but notice designs (physical and digital) that made
                    me think: <span>“Wow! This is such a pain to use for completing such a simple task”</span>. Every
                    time I
                    encountered such designs, I always kept thinking of methods to create a better user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I appreciated the whole UX and Human Centered Design process more and more. I was relieved when I 
                    stumbled upon a field that focused around technology, art and storyteling.

                        I’ve always liked to solve puzzles even when I was young, especially the Rubik’s Cube. I had my
                        fair share of speed cubing attempts, and my fastest time was 30 seconds!

                        If I had to choose a sport that only I could do forever in my life, it would be swimming.
                        Swimming makes me feel free, like I could just float away, forever.
